## ✨ Project Overview

**Groomify** is a frontend-only React project I built to practice my web development skills.  
The visual design of this site was originally created by **Justyna** on [Framer](https://groomify.framer.website/), and I have faithfully recreated it using **React**.

👉 **Live Demo**: [Groomify](https://shuvadip-ghosh.github.io/Groomify/)

⚠️ **Important Note**:  
- I do **not claim ownership** of the original design.  
- This project is built **strictly for personal learning purposes only**—not intended for commercial use, clients, or redistribution.  
- Full credit goes to the original designer for the UI/UX inspiration.
